# 📊 Manufacturing Defect Dashboard

This project analyzes manufacturing defect data using **SQL** and **Excel**, focusing on identifying trends in defect rates, additive material costs, downtime, and quality scores. It presents a clean, insightful dashboard designed to simulate real-world defect analysis in a production environment.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To uncover patterns behind high-defect records using manufacturing metrics like additive cost, defect rate, and production volume. The project aims to simulate how a junior data analyst at a company like **Axion Ray** might explore and communicate defect-related insights to support quality and cost-reduction initiatives.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** (Dashboarding, Data Cleaning)
- **SQLite / DB Browser** (SQL Queries, Filtering)
- **SQL** (Filtering, Aggregation, Joins)

## 📌 Key Insights

- 🔺 **Top 5 High-Cost Additive Materials** are also linked with high defect rates  
- ⚙️ DefectStatus = 1 accounts for ~84% of total downtime  
- 📈 Production volume does not always correlate with better quality — some high-volume items still have high defect rates  
- 🔍 Quality Score fluctuates even at similar additive costs, suggesting need for process optimization beyond material inputs
